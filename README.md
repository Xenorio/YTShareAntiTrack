YouTube userscript to remove tracking parameters from share URLs

## Explanation

Recently, YouTube started adding a tracking parameter to their share URLs, when using the "share" button on a video. With this, they can track who is sharing videos with who, and under some circumstances even how they are shared.

This userscript removes any parameters from this box, allowing you to safely copy the link without needing to manually modify it.
